          Hey, my name is Allen Harborth. I served 6 years in the United States Air Force, where I served 2 years at kadena AB in Okinawa Japan, and 3 years at Yokota AB in Fussa Japan. I still serve in the Air Force reserve part time through Lackland AB at San Antonio. Originally, I’m from Eastland Texas. I am currently taking a class for web development. I first began getting deeper into computers when I made my first computer for gaming. I then began teaching myself Python. Later, I was taught Java while going to college for computer science. Some of the other things I was taught in college were C++, SQL,software design methods and hardware architecture. I look forward to a career in web development and computer science.
